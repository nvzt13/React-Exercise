```
5. What is the difference between fetch and axios?
```
Browser support: Fetch is built into modern web browsers and is supported by all major browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. Axios, on the other hand, is not built into browsers and must be installed as a separate library.
Node.js support: Axios supports both the browser and node.js environments, while Fetch is primarily designed for use in the browser.
Request cancellation: Axios supports request cancellation, while Fetch does not.
Interceptors: Axios supports interceptors, which allow you to intercept and modify requests and responses before they are handled by the rest of the application. Fetch does not have a built-in interceptor mechanism, but you can use middleware or other libraries to achieve similar functionality.
Automatic data transformation: Axios automatically transforms request and response data to JSON, while Fetch does not.
Error handling: Axios provides more detailed error messages and handles network errors more gracefully than Fetch.
Size: Axios is larger than Fetch, with a larger bundle size and more dependencies.
```
